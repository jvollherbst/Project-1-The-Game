# Project #1: The Gameâ€”Proposal

Based on the german card game [Ghost Blitz](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/83195/ghost-blitz),
this game will test the player's memory and reflexes. The game begins by displaying five different objects in five different colors. At the start of the game, the player is shown an image containing four objects. Sometimes three of the objects will be in the wrong color, and the user must select the object with the **correct** color. Other times, all of the colors will be wrong, and the user must select the object that **does not appear** in the image.

**User Story**
- As a player I want to understand the rules of the Game
- The game will display an image of five shapes, in five different colors
- I will only have a few seconds to look at and remember the image
- The game will then hide the image
- The game will next display a set of shapes in different colors, but only one will match an object from the original set
- I will then have a few seconds to select the correct object from this new set of items
- If I guess correctly, I score a point
- If I do not guess correctly, the computer will alert me that I am wrong, and show the correct answer
- The game will display my score
- Player 2 will go next, repeating the steps above
- As a player, I want the option to end the game by choice
- I want the game to alert me that the game is over

Bonus: The speed will increase as I progress through the game
