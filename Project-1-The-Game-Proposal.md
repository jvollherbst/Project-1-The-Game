# Project #1: The Gameâ€”Proposal

Based on the german card game [Ghost Blitz](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/83195/ghost-blitz),
this game will test the player's memory and reflexes. The game begins by displaying five different objects in five different colors. At the start of the game, the player is shown an image containing four objects. Sometimes three of the objects will be in the wrong color, and the user must select the object with the **correct** color. Other times, all of the colors will be wrong, and the user must select the object that **does not appear** in the image.

**User Story**
- As a user, I want the game to display the instructions
- The game will display an empty container
- The container will display an image of five shapes
- The five shapes will be in five different colors
- As a user, I will only have a few seconds to look at and remember the image
- The game will then hide the image
- The game will create a new container below the hidden image
- The game will next display a new set of shapes in different colors
- Only one will match an object from the original set
- As a user, I will need to select the object from this new set of items that matches the hidden set
- If my choice is correctly, I score a point
- The game will display my score
- If my choice is wrong, the game will alert me that I am wrong
- As a user, I want the game to show me the correct answer
- Player 2 will go next, repeating the steps above
- As a player, I want the game to run for 10 rounds
- As a player, I want the option to end the game by choice
- I want the game to alert me that the game is over

Bonus:
- The speed will increase as I progress through the game
- The game will increase in complexity
