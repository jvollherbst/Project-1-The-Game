# A Simple Memory Game
_project owner Jasmine Vollherbst_

"A Simple Memory Game" is my first attempt to build a JavaScript web application from scratch completely on my own.
This exercise has taught me how to work with objects, declare and call functions, work with arrays, and use jQuery for DOM manipulation.

### Game Outline
The game randomly pulls from an array library of images. The images are displayed in the browser, and the player has only a few seconds to memorize their sequence. After a few seconds, the images are shuffled, and the player must click on the shuffled images in their original order. The player scores a point if correct, or receives an alert if they are incorrect. The game then switches over to player two, who repeats the preceding steps. The game continues for three rounds, and will then then declare a winner.

### Process
My approach was very playful and naive. Because my understanding of JavaScript is still very limited, I wanted to above all walk away from this project with a working game and a better understanding of how to use functions, objects, and arrays. I first outlined the basic structure of how I wanted the game to work and broke out each section into smaller pieces. While mindful of best practices and style guides, I concentrated on a trial and error approach by testing my individual functions in the console and browser.

I chose to keep the UI very basic to allow me to spend more time concentrating on JavaScript, which is my weak point.

Some challenges I faced that I will continue to improve on are not taking advantage of constructor functions or prototypes. My primary goal was to become more comfortable with writing JavaScript overall, but for my next project I would like to tackle something more challenging to ensure that I am pushing myself.
